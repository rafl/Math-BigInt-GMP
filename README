Module to replace Math::BigInt's core math routines by using Math::GMP.

(C) ..--- ----- ----- .---- by - . .-.. ... .-.-.-  All rights reserved.

This package contains a replacement (drop-in) module for Math::BigInt's core,
Math::BigInt::Calc.pm. It needs the new versions of Math::BigInt and
Math::BigFloat as they are from Perl 5.7.x onwards.

How to install (replace the version below with the current one):

	tar -xzf Math-BigInt-GMP-1.10.tar.gz
	cpansign --verify

If the signature does not verify ok, you might to install Module::Signature
and get my key from <http://bloodgate.com/tels.asc>.

If the signature still does not verify okay, notify me. DO NO INSTALL this
package when the signature is BAD - your system might get compromised!

If the signature is good, do:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test

and then as root:

	make install


To use this module, replace:

	use Math::BigInt;

with this:

	use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP';

or alternatively something like:
	
	use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP,Pari,BitVect';

Please read the documentation under PERFORMANCE in Math::BigInt on when to
use this module and when not. As of v1.10 and Math::BigInt v1.64/v1.64, using
"lib => 'GMP'" will actually reduce the memory consumption of your program,
and thanx to the fact that we no longer use Math::GMP but have our own XS
code, almost all operations should be faster than just using Calc (the
default pure-perl library used in Math::BigInt).

So, the following:
	
	use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP';

can be heartily recommended.

More information including HTMLified help and preliminary benchmark results
are available under:

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
