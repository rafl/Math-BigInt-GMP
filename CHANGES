2010-09-21 v1.31 rafl 5559 tests  DEVELOPMENT RELEASE
  * Add hooks for Storable (de-)serialisation.
  * Avoid failure in the destructor if someone blessed nonsense into our class.

2010-09-20 v1.30 rafl 5558 tests
  * Re-upload 1.29 as a stable release without further changes.

2010-09-19 v1.29 rafl 5558 tests  DEVELOPMENT RELEASE
  * Attempt to fix a bug in the bundled version Devel::CheckLib.
    It used to ignore @Config{qw(ccflags ldflags)} and only tried to look for
    headers and libraries with the compiler's default include- and lib-paths as
    well as those explicitly asked for by the user.

2010-09-17 v1.28 rafl 5558 tests
  * Re-upload 1.27 without further changes as a stable release.

2010-09-15 v1.27 rafl 5558 tests  DEVELOPMENT RELEASE
  * Try to support perls older than 5.8.8 again.
    Tested with 5.8.7 and 5.6.2.

2010-09-14 v1.26 rafl 5558 tests  DEVELOPMENT RELEASE
  * Error out early if libgmp or gmp.h are missing.
  * Clone Math::BigInt::GMP instances on thread cloning.
    This should make the module threadsafe.

2010-09-10 v1.25 rafl 5536 tests
  * Fix tests with Math::BigInt >= 1.90 and depend on it.

2007-07-31 v1.24 Tels 5530 tests
  * apply patch for warnings about ptr size mismatch under Cygwin (thanx Reini Urban!)
  * make it work under 5.6.x again by defining SvUOK() (Thanx Marcus Holland-Moritz
    and Reini Urban!)

2007-07-25 v1.23 Tels 5527 tests
  * require Math::BigInt 1.87
  * fix for _new() (appeared under Cygwin, but possible others, thanx
    Linda W. (report) and Reini Urban (patch)!)

2007-06-01 v1.22 Tels 5527 tests
  * require Math::BigInt 1.86
  * support api_version() 2 by adding _nok()
  * fix compilation issues on Mac/Darwin
  * _log_int() modifies it's argument instead of just returning a
    different object as result
  * speed up _log_int() greatly by taking a guess of the result
    and then improve it, instead of startig with 1 and going up. This means
    it takes now a more or less constant time, instead of a time proportional
    to the size/value of the result:

2007-04-17 v1.21 Tels 5488 tests
  * add _as_oct(), _from_oct(), _alen(), _1ex() and some _root() tests
  * require Math::BigInt 1.83

  * _new(): take a shortcut if the passed an IV (integer value)

2007-04-09 v1.20 Tels 5351 tests
  * remove PREREQ_FATAL because the toolchain is broken and cannot handle it
  * take over tests from MBI 1.82 and require it
  * require Perl 5.6.2 as minimum
  * speed up _zeros():
    + use Newx() instead of a full-blown SV for temp storage
    + no need to allocate temp storage for numbers < 10
  * put _len() into XS code, making $x->length() faster (about 30% for "123",
    less for longer numbers as the binary=>decimal conversion dominates)
  * add POD tests
  * add MANIFEST.SKIP

2007-01-27 v1.19 Tels 5339 tests
  * add support for octal
  * take over tests from MBI 1.78 and require it

	div_l    1260    1300

2001-11-01 v1.04a Tels (never released)
  * _is_odd()/_is_even() use $two instead of 2: 5600 op/s instead of 4700
2002-01-26 v1.04 Tels
  * use $zero,$one,$two etc instead of 0,1,2 in some routines
  * tests from Math::BigInt v1.50
  * bypass Math::GMP's overload interface and use Math::GMP::gmp_foo() directly
  * added _gcd() and _fac() for more speed in bgcd() and bfac(), respectively
2002-02-16 v1.05 Tels
  * tests from Math::BigInt v1.51
  * replaced _core_lib() by config()->{lib}
  * added _and, _or, _xor (using Math::GMP internal methods)
  * switched _fac over to use Math::GMP gmp_fac()
  * added _sqrt() using gmp_sqrt()
  * used div_two and bdiv_two for _div()
  * tests for _div() in list context and _mod
  * added _from_hex()

  The speedups in band(), bxor(), bior() and bfac() are at least factor 10 for
  small numbers and quickly raise as the numbers grow ;)
  The speedup for bmod() and bdiv() aren't that dramatic, but still worth it.
2002-03-23 v1.06 Tels
  * testsuite from v1.55 - 3874 tests
  * fixed PREREQUISITES to Math::GMP v2.03, BigInt v1.55
  * fixed typos in CHANGES
  * added _from_bin()
2002-07-07 v1.07 Tels
  * testsuite from BigInt v1.60 - 4054 tests 
  * fixed PREREQUISITES to BigInt v1.60
2002-12-12 v1.08 Tels 4069 tests (never released)
  * added implementation of bmodpow() using GMPs mpow_gmp()
  * release signed by key http://bloodgate.com/tels.asc id 93B84C15
2002-12-15 v1.10a Tels Never released
  * no longer needs Math::GMP (and Carp), but uses own XS layer
  * is thus faster (saves one perl subroutine layer) and less memory hungry
    (it now uses even less memory than using Calc!)
    new XS lets us cut out a subroutine layer
  * new XS will enable us to implement *all* missing functions like _root(),
    _as_hex(), _as_bin() and _rsft(), _lsft()
  * fixed PREREQ to BigInt v1.65
  * extended tests in bigintg.t to cover more functions
2002-12-24 v1.10 Tels 4109 tests
  * Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all!
  * cut out more dead wood from GMP.xs, GMP.so file shrunk a bit
  * added some comments in GMP.xs
  * fixed PREREQ to BigInt v1.64 since v1.65 is not yet out *sigh*
  * more functions like _is_odd()/_is_even()/_acmp() directly in XS - cut away
    perl layer subroutines for more speed (about 10-30% more ops/s for small
    argument or constant cases or other cases where the overhead is greater
    than the actual math operation itself)
  * __stringify() no longer malloc()s a temp. storage => faster
  * added _root(), _lsft() and_rsft() functions for great speedups
  * Running the benchmark script above (adopted a bit) on the same 1 Ghz AMD
    under BigInt v1.64:
    Benchmark: running div_l, mod_l, mod_s for at least 3 CPU seconds...
      div_l:  3s ( 3.20 usr +  0.00 sys =  3.20 CPU) @ 4655.00/s (n=14896)
      mod_l:  4s ( 3.31 usr +  0.00 sys =  3.31 CPU) @ 6851.96/s (n=22680)
      mod_s:  3s ( 3.01 usr +  0.00 sys =  3.01 CPU) @ 7088.37/s (n=21336)
  * Full (memory and other) benchmarks at http://bloodgate.com/perl/bigint/
2003-01-01 v1.11 Tels 4109 tests
  * rewrote stringify_bin() and stringify_hex() to not allocate scratch buffers
    Faster, no longer needs malloc()/free() and strlen().
    Thanx to Sysiphus for pointing this out.
  * removed _as_hex() and _as_bin() from GMP.pm and moved the logic to GMP.xs 
  * documented in todo to replace all malloc()/free() with New and Safefree()
  * removed unused cmp_two() function in GMP.xs
  * removed the unused "$zero = ..."/"$one = ..." in GMP.pm
2003-01-08 v1.12a Tels 4109 tests (not released)
  * removed unused function _mmod from XS code
  * removed unnecc. if len == 0 check in _as_bin(), _as_hex() etc
  * replace some RETVAL = malloc() lines with defined to make changing them
    later much easier

  * testsuite from v1.65
  * fixed prereq to require BigInt v1.65

  * testsuite from v1.67, especialy revamped bigintg.t
  * fixed prereq to require BigInt v1.67
  * added _log_int() to XS code
  * some routines did only return the result, but not modify $x in place
2004-01-10 v1.13 Tels 4759 tests
  * tests from BigInt v1.68
  * removed DESTROY from GMP.pm and made GMP.xs destroy => DESTROY
  * removed _num from GMP.pm and made GMP.xs __stringify => _num
  * removed _modinv() from GMP.pm and fixed up _modinv in GMP.xs
  * disabled the borken _log_int() from the XS code
  * modify $x in place for _dec, _inc, _add, _mod, _mul, _fac, _and, _or,
    _xor, _sqrt, _root and _sub (sub in non-reversed form), this removes some
    malloc/free and makes these ops slightly faster
    (between 10 and 33% in Math::BigInt (!), depending on input and size)
2004-02-15 v1.14 Tels 4867 tests
  * require BigInt v1.70, use tests from it and make API compatible with it
  * _rsft() and _lsft() modify their argument instead of making a copy,
    meaning brsft() and blsft() got about 20% faster in BigInt

  * added a working _log_int() method
2004-11-22 v1.15 Tels 5112 tests

  * take over tests from Math::BigInt v1.74
  * require Math::BigInt v1.74
  * simplify sub code in XS (left-over artifact from v1.16)
  * fix a leak in _zeros()
  * _zeros() is now much faster for odd numbers (O(1) vs. O(N*N))
2005-04-11 v1.18 Tels 5186 tests
  * _log_int() handles now plain scalars as $base parameter
  * take over tests from MBI 1.76, require it
